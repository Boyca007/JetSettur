<h2>Paris: Day 0-1</h2>

<p class="date">[Day 0]  Tuesday,  10.25.2016</p>

<p>“OMG! This is it! Paris Oui Oui!” I had just got off work and it was time to jet home and get to the airport! We dropped Oliver off at the boarder’s the day before, bags are packed (and weighed), so we’re ready to cheese it.</p>

<p>Our flight took off at 8pm and flew into Frankfurt, Germany. From there, we’ve got an hour layover and a 1.5 hr flight until we’re in Paris! We decided to upgrade to the Premium Economy on the transatlantic leg, in hopes to get some rest overnight and be ready to do some sight-seeing when we land.</p>

<p>We were on a 747-400, a MASSIVE plane. I’ve never seen so many people board an aircraft.    The premium economy turned out to absolutely be worth it. It was a little pricey ($250/person), but you got the “even more space” type seat. We sat at the bulk head which I really liked; Collin wasn’t so much a fan. I was very impressed with the food (served hot and on glassware, and so yummy!), and they offered beer, wine, champagne (or ‘sparkling wine’, as I was corrected more than once). Overall I loved the upgrade so much we ended up doing it on the way back (unplanned expense, of course). And yet, despite the extra room and comforts, I still got about an hour of sleep.</p><br><br>

<p class="date">[Day 1]  Wednesday,  10.26.2016</p>

<p>Waiting in the Frankfurt airport was miserable because I could barely keep my eyes open. They made us do this weird turn around where we had to walk all the way down the terminal, stamp our passports, go down the stairs, then walk all the way back. Weird foreign customs I suppose. We got a bratwurst from one of the cart vendors because it smelled incredible – very disappointing. Room temperature and tough. But hey, you had to try it, right?</p>

<p>Anyway from there, we get on the plane, zonked out for most of it, then wake up and we’re touching down at Charles De Gaulle! We get off the plane, and head toward baggage claim. The airport is very pretty, although very old. They have this large glass atrium with escalators going across. It feels a little like a scene from an old Sci-Fi film. At baggage claim, I swear our bags were one of the last to come off the belt, a solid 20 minutes at least. It could’ve been that I’d gotten 2 hours of sleep, but it felt like an eternity. Finally, bags are in hand. Let’s get to the hotel. Uncharted territory: begin.</p>

<br>

<p>There is no substitute for having done or seen something. If you’ve done it and you’re explaining it to someone else, you can walk them through every step of the process, but they’ll never know it as intimately as you do until they do it themselves. That’s how transportation felt. I had scrutinized the damn subway map, yet I still had so many unanswered questions. “What’s the difference between the Metro and the RER? Can I just hop between them? Is it easy to find and navigate? Does the average Joe [or Jacques] use it or is it all homeless people? Is it easy with luggage? What’s the best pass to buy, or does it make more sense to pay per use?” I can’t express the frustration I had trying to plan it out before the trip. It felt like there was no clear answer, and there was no way to know in advance.</p>

<p>All this to say, it was actually incredibly easy. Worry for not. We follow the signs for the RER and it takes us to the ticket window. We had worked it out ahead of time, and the Navigo week pass was perfect. It goes Monday – Sunday, which mostly lined up with our time there. It was also pretty cheap. We buy the tickets, head down the stairs to the train.</p>

<p>For some reason at this point, the stress of being in a 100% foreign city hits me. I know the route on the map [Take the B to get into the city, then transfer at Gare du Nord for the E, then get off at St-Lazare], but now it’s real and we’re here and suddenly none of it makes sense. I have no idea if we’re in the right spot for the right train; the idea of getting lost, not speaking the language and being stranded is a very real possibility. Panic attack quickly approaching… Luckily, Collin swoops in with level-headedness and reason, and calms me down. We wait for the train to come, and we hop on.</p>

<p>Now, after doing LOTS of research about Paris prior to going, I was legitimately terrified of getting pick-pocketed or straight up robbed. It’s hyped up quite a bit. Some blogs even said nothing on your person is safe because pick-pocketers can get into everything. With this as my filter, we are sitting on the train with two massive suitcases and it is so blatantly obvious that we are tourists. I can’t help but think that everyone is staring at our bags like fresh meat, waiting to be devoured. We may have well been wearing signs “please take all of our stuff”. It didn’t help that the RER B-line takes you through a few stops I would NOT feel comfortable getting off at. At one point, this group of Teenage Romanian Rappers gets on and they start free styling. In the moment, I was terrified. Looking back it was kinda cool.</p>

<p>Finally, we make it to our transfer station: Gare du Nord. This was our first taste of how large the subway stations can be. IT’s FLIPPING HUGE. It was a solid 15-20 minute walk to get off and transfer to the E line. And remind you: we still didn’t know where to look to find the information we needed to make sure we were getting on the right train. So there was a lot of back and forth. Finally we find the E train heading toward Haussman / St-Lazare. It’s a much shorter trip.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re done with the subway. We get off, walk up the closest stairs we can find and… BAM! The most beautiful site: the city streets of Paris. DSC_2759.jpg</p>

<p>Instant rush of joy. Quickly followed by the uncanny observation that there are no street signs, and there is no discernible way to tell if we’re walking in the right direction. Help! Alright Collin, time to flip on the data to find our way to the hotel. A brisk walk and we’re finally there. What a journey! [The picture above isn’t actually at the Haussman station – we were far too stressed and tired to think of taking a picture – but it’s a good indication of what the streets are like]. BTW – The street signs are on the sides of the buildings, far above eye height. </p>

<blockquote><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Just take an uber to and from the airport. Trying to figure out the Transportation on-the-fly, while tired and stressed, with luggage… sucks. The $30 will be worth it.</blockquote>

<p>Our hotel was absolutely gorgeous: Hyatt Paris Madeleine. Our room wasn’t quite ready so we relax in the lobby, while we pick up the scattered pieces of our stressed out brains. When we get our room, we rest up for a few hours and unpack, before it’s back out on the town! So much to see and so little time! There are a few quick things on the itinerary. Shouldn’t be too bad.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of booking the hotel we did was how close it is to a lot of the major sites and subway. You can easily get wherever you need to be. We walk down to the Madeleine, about 5 minutes, and it is so beautiful! The huge columns that tower over you; the detail in the statues. There are several great statues inside as well (plus it’s warm on a cold day).dsc_2782The front of the Madeleine overlooks the Place de Concord, which is home to the Obelisk. It’s a short walk to the square from the Madeleine. Beautiful sights surround you; the Madeleine behind you, Louvre to your left, Arc de Triomphe to your right… It’s so nice, but the pictures leave out all the traffic. Quite busy.dsc_2781</p>

<p>We turn right, and walk down the Champs Elysses (pronounced “Chomps Elee-say”). The first part is so cute! It’s a little wooded area with market lights and is so romantic. We see a little crepe stand and figure we’ll grab a bite to eat. HOLY MOLY. I’ve never had something so amazing in my entire life. It’s crisp, yet soft. Moist but not too sweet. Pure heaven.</p>

<p>We keep walking down the street (still in Nutella crepe ecstasy), and the rest of it iconic shopping. Big lights, big stores, bustling street. We stop for some real food, and then finally get to the Arc. It’s so much bigger than it seems! dsc_2792</p>

<p>£12 and 287 spiraling steps later, we finally get to the top! It’s exhausting, but the view at the top is so amazing and so worth it!</p>

<p>After we rest up for a bit and soak in the view, it’s time to get home. If you couldn’t tell, we did a hell of a lot of walking (way more than I had expected; it looks so close on the map!). Whoops, might have over done it. We find the closest subway station and go back to the hotel. (Charles De Gaulle Etolle – A line to Opera, switch to the 8 towards Madeleine).</p>

<p>Push sru for day 2!</p>

<p>Tip: save the PDF train map to your phone (such as a PDF page on iBooks), so you can still get the map and you don’t have to use data.

Tip: Use Google Maps to navigate – it works in airplane mode so you don’t have to use data. You’ll just want to make sure you pre-load the area when you’re on wifi.

Tip: Use the My Maps within Google Maps. It helps with planning. I color coded mine based on the day of the trip. With a back-up of things I wanted to do if we had some extra time.</p>
