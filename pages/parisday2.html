<h2>Paris: Day 2</h2>

<p class="date">[Day 2] Thursday 10.27.2016</p>

<p>BEEP BEEP BEEP!!! Time to wake up! It’s about 7:30am Paris Time, and one of the first things I noticed is that we adjusted instantly to the time zone. I felt instantly adjusted because we were so exhausted from the day before.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Tip:</strong> One of the best tips I read while planning was about adjusting to the time change. Do what you can to sleep on the plane and take an early bed time, but whatever you do don’t nap! Push through it, and when you wake up you’ll be caught up.</blockquote>

<p>First thing on today’s itinerary: The Louvre. Famous for all of the incredible pieces of art, most notably the Mona Lisa. We bought our tickets in advance, where they make you pick a time to enter. I chose to go right at opening: 9am.</p>

<p>The plan is walk down to the Madeleine, and there’s a metro stop right there. Hop on the 14 to Pyramides, switch to the 7 and get off at the Musee de Louvre and we’re there!</p>

<p>But most importantly, breakfast and coffee. As we’re walking to the metro station, we see a little bakery on the side of street. Perfect – we’re good on time, let’s grab something. We go in and I attempt to order in french (coffee and a few croissants), she responds in english.. well, at least I tried… and says we can go take a seat and she’ll bring it right out. HOLY MOLY AGAIN! I’m not exaggerating, this croissant was unbelievable. No other pastry I’ve ever had or will ever have compares to how flakey, buttery and melt-in-your-mouth this thing was. Needless to say, we were in food heaven yet again. dsc_2832</p>

<p>Alright, time to cheese it. We get to the metro station, and by this time we’ve been on it a few times and it’s starting to click:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Tip:</strong> The idea is to always look for the last stop, that indicates which direction the train is going. It’s pretty easy to walk on a train going in the opposite direction, so before you get on a train, make sure it’s:

The right number / color
The right end destination
We successfully navigate the subway, and make it to the Louvre! dsc_2840</blockquote>

<p>When we walk up, all of the lines are super short. We go to the pre-purchased tickets line and have to wait about 10 minutes or so. We got to go in first, but had we not pre-purchased our tickets I’m not sure it would’ve made a huge difference this early in the morning. I imagine if was later or at a busier time, it would’ve definitely been the way to go. Once they open up the doors, we go in the pyramid and down the escalator. Here’s a link to the website’s map for reference. There are 3 wings (Denon Wing, Sully Wing, and Richelieu Wing), and 4-ish floors. They check your tickets at each of main entrances to each wing, which is also where you get the audioguide (if you want it, it’s £5 extra. I liked having it because it was very informational, but it was a bit annoying at times). From there we jet straight to the Mona Lisa. When we get to the room, there was open space at the front of the bar. DEFINITELY the way to do it. Even by the time we left the room was already getting busy.</p>

<p>The picture on the right is in the same room on the opposite wall. The painting is 20′ x 30′ and is the largest painting at the Louvre (that’s me on the left). Quite the contrast to the Mona Lisa – it’s so small!</p>

<blockquote><strong>Tip:</strong> For the Louvre, buy your tickets in advance and go at 9 am. Go straight to the Mona Lisa, and map out everything else on your “must-see” list</blockquote>

<p>I can absolutely see why people spend all day in this one building. I had mapped out ahead of time of all the major things I wanted to see and where they were located. I’m so glad I did. All in all, we were in and out in about 3 hours. Not bad for seeing all the best of history!</p>

<p><em>Quick disclaimer: We aren’t really museum people, but the Louvre was obviously a must-see. But it was the only one we saw.</em> </p>

<p>After the Louvre, we walked the Jardins de Tuilleres. There were tons of chairs around a fountain, so we sat down and relaxed for a little while.</p>

<p>After that it was about a 15 minute walk over to the Place de Vendome. It was a very neat statue with shops, but otherwise not much to see. Back to the hotel to rest up for a little while. dsc_3012</p>

<p>On the way back, we walked into a cute little bistro for some lunch. It was quite a shock to see how tight they shove the tables together! You could literally touch elbows while eating with the people having a meal next to you. This was also the first time I ordered “cafe” and got espresso. And of course french onion soup was on the menu, so we had to try it. (Collin and I try French Onion Soup everywhere we go and compare). Oddly enough we didn’t like it! Overall lunch was an experience, but wasn’t very impressed.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Tip:</strong> French coffee is unbelievably strong for my “weak” American palette. If you order a ‘cafe’, you’ll find yourself with an espresso. If you want regular coffee, either find a Starbucks or ask for “cafe americano”. It’s basically watered down espresso, but it’s still stronger than regular drip coffee.</blockquote>

<p>After a few hours of downtime at the hotel, time to hit the city again. Similar to the Louvre, if you pre-buy the tickets you have to pick a window. I chose 5pm because it was as close as I could get to sunset at 6:30, plus it gave us plenty of time in between the Louvre. Also make sure to buy the ticket to get to the “Summit”. We go back to the Madeleine (the location of our hotel is really paying off) and get on the 8 towards Balard. We switch to the 6 at La Motte and take it to the Champs de Mars stop. Off the train and it’s a 5 minute walk until you see the most iconic building in the world.</p>

<p>We were a bit early, so we had to wait before we could go up. There are signs all in the elevators saying “Beware of Pick-Pocketers”, and I can definitely see why, it’s very tight getting up there. After a few quick lines and packed elevator rides, we made it to the top, and it is such an amazing view!</p>

 
<p>Once we saw everything there was to see, time to head back down. The Elevators were SO busy, so we take the the stairs. It was a little scary, but it was cool!</p>

<p>Next up is the river cruise, it doesn’t depart until 8:30. We wait at the steps down by the river, have another crepe (of course), and soak in the scenery. The river cruise was really nice! Very romantic, the food was pretty good, and you really can’t beat the sights.</p>

<p>Well… we didn’t get back to the dock until midnight, home at 1am. Whoops! Tomorrow is going to come mighty early! Off to bed!</p>
